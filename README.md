# Puzzle Game in C++ using SFML

This is a Puzzle Game developed in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML).  
It focuses on building interactive gameplay with multimedia support and basic game architecture.

## GAME FEATURES

The game includes classic puzzle mechanics:

- Players rearrange scrambled tiles to form a complete image.  
- A graphical interface displays puzzle tiles, background, and level screen.  
- Background music adds immersion to the player experience.  
- Levels are visualized using static images such as `levels.JPG`.  
- Custom fonts and images are used for enhanced visual appeal.

## GAME ARCHITECTURE

The code is structured with core C++ logic and SFML modules:

- The `main.cpp` file contains the game loop and rendering logic.  
- SFML is used to handle graphics, audio, fonts, and events.  
- Game assets include images (`.JPG`), fonts (`.TTF`), and audio (`.MP3`).  
- Dynamic libraries (`.dll`) support multimedia functionality at runtime.

This project showcases my ability to build a complete desktop game using C++ and SFML.  
It reflects my understanding of multimedia programming, graphical rendering, and game loop structure in C++ development.
